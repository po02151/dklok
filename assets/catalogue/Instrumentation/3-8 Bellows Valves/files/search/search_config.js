This design with the secondary sealing system fits to the need\u000d\u000afor a safe and reliable system.\u000d\u000aApplications include cryogenic to high temperatures, high pressure to\u000d\u000avacuum in power plants, instrumentation, panels, and critical sampling\u000d\u000asystem for toxic, radioactive, and hazardous fluids.\u000d\u000aBellows subassembly (Figure 1)\u000d\u000aWelding upper end of the bellows to 12. stem (weld 1) and the other\u000d\u000aend to 19. stem weld ring (weld 2), this bellows is then welded to the\u000d\u000avalve body (weld 3).\u000d\u000aBellows subassembly with the three places of welding provides all metal, hermetical sealed valve. This primary seal offers a complete sealing\u000d\u000abetween the system and atmosphere where leakage is not accepted.\u000d\u000aSecondary seal (6), (18).\u000d\u000aAll welded stainless steel valves with secondary seal makes this valve for \u000d\u000athe most difficult fluid containment applications.\u000d\u000aSecondary sealing prevents leakage to atmosphere in the event of a\u000d\u000abellows rupture due to excessive pressurization. Leakage past the primary seal is contained by secondary seal.\u000d\u000aActuator threads (2)\u000d\u000aHardened 440C stainless steel actuator is for maximum strength, wear\u000d\u000aresistance, and positive stem retraction.\u000d\u000aAcme power transmission threads constructed on actuator (2) and the\u000d\u000abonnet (8) for low operation torque and to handle the extreme force\u000d\u000atransmitted to the threads in high pressure bellows valve.
