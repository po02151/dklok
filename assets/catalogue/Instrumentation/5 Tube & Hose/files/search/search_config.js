Weld tubing\u000d\u000aNote:\u000d\u000aTubing has many benefits against piping\u000d\u000a\u2022 Pipe threading or welding is difficult to disassemble and\u000d\u000are-assemble.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Piping requires skilled worker for welding & threading.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Piping is bulky.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Tubing is assembled by simple wrench make-up on DK-Lok Tube \u000d\u000aFittings reducing assembly time and the overall cost of\u000d\u000ainstallation.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Tubing is bendable, allowing lower pressure drop with fewer\u000d\u000aconnections. This in turn reduces costs with less fabricating\u000d\u000amanpower.\u000d\u000aFor safe, reliable and leak-free tubing system for use with DK-Lok\u000d\u000aFittings , tubing should be considered as one of fitting components.\u000d\u000aThe following parameters should be considered when ordering\u000d\u000ainstrumentation bright annealed seamless and welded tubing.\u000d\u000a1.

Tubing must be softer than fitting material. The metal tubing\u000d\u000amust be fully annealed and suitable for bending and flaring.\u000d\u000a2. Tubing hardness must be selected according to the information\u000d\u000ain the table 4 and 5.\u000d\u000a3. Tubing must have a surface free from scratches, draw mark, dirt,\u000d\u000adurst and flat spots.\u000d\u000a4. Tubing in oval or out-of-roundness may not fit into the fitting.\u000d\u000aDo not force the tubing into the fitting; it may damage the fitting\u000d\u000asealing system on the nut, ferrules, and body.\u000d\u000aUsing like tubing and fitting material is essential for the thermal\u000d\u000acompatibility and corrosion resistance. Different materials have\u000d\u000adifferent hardness level that may adversely affect the fitting seal\u000d\u000aon tubing. The only exception is copper tubing with brass DK-Lok\u000d\u000aFittings.\u000d\u000aThe table 4 and 5 show tubing working pressure ratings in a wide\u000d\u000arange of wall thickness. A too thin of a wall may collapse and too\u000d\u000athick wall may not properly be deformed by the ferrule action.\u000d\u000aDK-Lok Fittings are not recommended for tube wall thickness not\u000d\u000alisted in the table 4 and 5.\u000d\u000aGases such as nitrogen, air, hydrogen and helium, can escape\u000d\u000aeven the most minute leak path due to their small molecules.\u000d\u000aHeavy wall tubing resists ferrule action by coining out minor\u000d\u000adefects of the tube surface whereas a thin wall may collapse with\u000d\u000alittle resistance to ferrule action. For gas service, use heavy wall in\u000d\u000awhite in table 4 and 5.\u000d\u000aThe weld bead should not be noticeable visually on the outside\u000d\u000aof the tube.\u000d\u000aTubing of ornamental, structural or mechanical grade should not be used for fluid \u000d\u000asystem.\u000d\u000aSolution annealed.\u000d\u000aAll dimensions are in millimeters unless otherwise specified and only for reference subject to change. www.dklok.com\u000d\u000aDK-Lok Tubing","2\u000d\u000aTubing Handling\u000d\u000aTubing Installation System pressure\u000d\u000aWelded Tubing Working Pressure\u000d\u000aTable 1.\u000d\u000aTable 2.

The wrong cutter may result in excessive deformation of the tube end.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Do not cut deep with each turn of cutter.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Tube cutters and hacksaws should be sharp enough.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Hacksaw blades should have at least 32 teeth per inch.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Deburring tube ends before inserting in the tube fittings helps prevent against system containments.\u000d\u000aWhen tube bend is too close to a fitting, the bend section shall enter\u000d\u000athe fitting. This may not allow the tube to be bottomed out in the\u000d\u000afitting, and may result in leakage.\u000d\u000aKeep the proper straight length of tube as shown in table 1 below.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Do not bend a tube in the fitting. Use tube bender.\u000d\u000aAs per ASME B31.3 Code for weld tubing working pressure, de-rating\u000d\u000afactors below must be applied. For double butt weld tubing multiply\u000d\u000aby 0.85 and for single butt weld tubing multiply by 0.80.\u000d\u000aWhen Elastomer seal is used in the system, care must be taken for\u000d\u000aallowable working temperature.
